Merge two sorted lists

LINE 15 - 16
first we create a dummy list to iterate through both l1 and l2
Then we create a head list to hold the value of dummy

LINE 17 - 28
while l1 and l2 isn't null, if the value in l1 is less than the value in l2, assign that value to dummy (remember it follows this order cause it's a sorted list)
	else vice verse, then we extend the l1 to the next.

LINE 29
we also extend dummy to the next

LINE 33 - 41
if while loop is over, but probably there's still one more list element left, this is probably the last value
we set it, then return the head.next

why head.next?

the first value of our dummy list is zero and we do not want to include that.
